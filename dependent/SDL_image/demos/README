    run "make"

THE PROGRAMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

viewimage.c
    demonstrates:
        IMG_Load

    try:
        ./viewimage lena.bmp
        ./viewimage lena.gif
        ./viewimage lena.jpg
        etc...

    usage:
        press any key to quit, or close the window as usual.
        try loading lena.xbm to see a failure.

formats.c
    demonstrates:
        IMG_Load
        supported file formats

    try:
        ./formats
    
    usage:
        when run, it will try loading files of the possibly supported formats in
        SDL_image.  then it tells you whether they can be loaded or not.
        if you see one that cannot be loaded, either the image file is corrupt,
        or you need to recompile SDL_image and make sure it supports that
        image format.
