This is SDL_gui, a Graphical User Interface library
that runs on top of SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer).

SDL_gui is a (slightly) higher level library than SDL.
It provides widgets and containers, and an event loop.
The library is written in C++, and widget classes can be
extended by deriving from them.

The older (0.9.x) C interface still exists for now, but
it will not be extended as new features are added.

It requires the following libraries:

SDL >= 1.1.2
SDL_image >= 1.0.9
SDL_ttf >= 1.2.0

SDL_gui is released under the LGPL.

The home site for SDL_gui is http://www.newimage.com/~rhk/SDL_gui
and the author is Ray Kelm (rhk@newimage.com).

If you have any suggestions, patches, (complaints?) etc please
feel free to send email.
