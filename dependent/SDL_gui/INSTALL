1. Configure

    If you checked out the library from CVS.

        ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr

    otherwise,

        ./configure --prefix=/usr

    I usually add --prefix=/usr, since that's where I keep SDL,
    but it is not required.

2. Build the library:

	make

3. Install the library and headers. Do this as root.

	make install

4. Test the library

	cd demo
	./uitest
